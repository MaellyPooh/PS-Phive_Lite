# PS-Phive Lite

Lite version of PS-Phive! with a more minimalist design.

Cache file included to install the menu to the user guide (English language only) <br>and to http://ps-phive/index.html

You can build a payload that will install this cache for you.

Original BIN file for the ESP32-S2 by Leeful included.

Changes:
  - Added latest GoldHEN v2.4b18.
  - Added linux loader and temperature payloads with selection menu.
  - Removed GTAV and RDR2 payloads.
  - Updated all descriptions, some icons and a new background image.
  - All payloads updated.

Others:   
  - Added some missing payloads, like pkgbackup and dumpers.
  - Fix settings not opening when GH Binloader was running.

Todo (it would be nice to have):
  - Add miraloader for linux payloads (they only work with GolhHEN binloader server).
  - Save linux loader and fan temperature selection (they reset after reloading the page)
  - Add minimal transition effects.
  - Add compressed payloads support.
